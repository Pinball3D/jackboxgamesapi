A simple script that uses the jackbox ecast server to make a playable game. I belive I have every app tag as I have copied the code from jackbox.tv, but if there are any missing, please submit through a pull request.

I was able to obtain the current information by decompiling the .SWF files and looking at api calls. It would be nice to have more functionality such as showing avalible player icons, but I have not been able to crack that. I used [jpexs flash decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler).

# How To Use
make an instance of the host() class and input an appTag. Use the appTags enum.
